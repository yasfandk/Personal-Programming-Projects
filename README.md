## About Me
Having studied Economics for over six years (undergraduate and master's), I have used data science and its concepts regularly for various projects, both personal and professional, over the past six years. In 2019, I did an internship where I was introduced to Python and its uses. Having only strictly used STATA prior to that, Python opened a whole new world of possibilities to me. I mainly used both STATA and Python for my Economics research and courses, however, now I have started to use my skills to explore different passion projects of mine which I will showcase over [here](https://github.com/yasfandk/Personal-Programming-Projects).
